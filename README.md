I recently completed a web development assignment that involved building a small website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap ðŸ“š. I took this opportunity seriously and decided to code the entire website myself, which was a first for me ðŸŽ‰. As expected, it took a significant amount of time and effort to complete, but I learned a lot throughout the process and gained valuable hands-on experience ðŸ“Š. This exercise helped me apply theoretical concepts to a real-world scenario and solidify my understanding of front-end development ðŸ’¡.
